# ManyBody-345
Classical gravitionational 3-body problem, also known as 
__*Pythagorean Three-Body Problem*__. 

In 1893, Meissel stated what is now called the Pythagorean three-body problem: 
Three masses in the ratio 3:4:5 are placed at rest at the vertices 
of a 3:4:5 right triangle. 
Burrau further investigated this problem in 1913. 
In 1967 Victor Szebehely and C. Frederick Peters established eventual 
escape for this problem using numerical integration, while at the same 
time finding a nearby periodic solution.

Three masses in the ratio 3:4:5 are placed at rest at the vertices of
a 3:4:5 right triangle.

# Verlet integration

Equation of motion for classical conservative system:

`V(r(t))` = potential energy function

Force `F = - grad (V(r(t)) )`

Velocity Verlet:

Given initial conditions `r(0)`, `v(0)`, compute acceleration `a(0)`.

```text
for time step t

v(t + 0.5 dt) := v(t) + 0.5*dt*a(t)
r(t + dt) := r(t) + v(t + 0.5 dt)*dt

compute a(t+dt) based on computed r(t+dt).

v(t+dt) := v(t+0.5dt) + 0.5*dt*a(t+dt)
```

N.B. acceleration `a(t+dt)` canâ€™t depend on `v` because `v(t+0.5dt)` is 
at different time point.

# Scales

The masses are in ratio 3:4:5 in mass and separation,
and located in relative positions 

| particle | position | mass | 
|----------|----------|------|
| M1       | (1,3)    | 3    |
| M2       | (-2,-1)  | 4    |
| M3       | ( 1,-1)  | 5    |

such that the centre of mass is (0,0).


# Task 1: Study of convergence 

Use several threads to run the integrations with different 
step size to see how they will converge when the step is 
"sufficiently small".

In Particle.cpp, test002(), which uses different dt to
approach a given time, then compare the total energy of the 
system, found that, the energy varies very much.

## Side-track to Halley Comet
Try to study a similar system, Halley comet, with the same Vector and
Particle classes as the 3-4-5 system.
